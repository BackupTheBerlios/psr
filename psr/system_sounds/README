This directory can contain the system sounds. If you would like a
certain sound played every time some specific command is passed to
PSR, you can place a .wav file in this directory and it will be
played before the command is executed.

Currently, the following are supported:

    help
    list
    listlog
    move
    mute
    play
    proxy_msg
    save
    speak
    status
    unmute

For example, my personal installation has the Clapper "clap clap"
sound in this directory named "mute.wav" and "unmute.wav", and
people tend to get a kick out of that.
